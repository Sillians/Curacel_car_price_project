    "With the increase of car ownership, used car market\n",

    "evaluation is essential for the healthy development of used\n",
    "car market. The prices of new cars in the industry are fixed\n",
    "by the manufacturer with some additional costs incurred\n",
    "by the Government in the form of taxes. But due to the\n",
    "increased price of new cars and incapability of customers\n",
    "to buy new cars due to the lack of funds, used cars sales\n",
    "are on a global increase. Predicting the prices of used cars\n",
    "is therefore an interesting and much-needed problem that\n",
    "needs to be addressed.\n",
    "Given the description of used cars, prediction of used cars\n",
    "is not an easy task. It is trite knowledge that the value of\n",
    "used cars depends on various factors\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important ones are usually the \n",
    "\n",
    " * age of the car\n",
    " * its make (and model),\n",
    " * the origin of the car (the original country of the manufacturer), \n",
    " * its mileage (the number of kilometers it has run) and \n",
    " * its horsepower. \n",
    " \n",
    "Due to rising fuel prices, \n",
    " * fuel economy also has a prime importance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some special factors which buyers attach importance is the \n",
    " * local of previous owners, whether the car had been involved in serious accidents and whether it is a lady-driven car. \n",
    " * The look and feel of the car contributes a lot to the price. \n",
    " \n",
    " As we can see, the price depends on various different factors. Unfortunately, information about all these factors is not\n",
    "always available and the buyer must make the decision to purchase at a certain price based on few factors only.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we propose a methodology using Machine Learning to predict the prices of used cars given the features. The\n",
    "price is estimated based on the number of features. We then deploy a responsive website to display our results that consist of all the various listings of used cars. This deployed service is a result of our work, and it incorporates the data, ML model with the features. This methodology can aid in the decision making of the users who are looking to buy a used car. It also provides users with the freedom to search all the available cars at one place without moving, anywhere and at any time.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the digital world, there have been many different implementations that have been used to effectively predict the\n",
    "price of a vehicle using different algorithms right from the machine learning algorithms of multiple linear regression, knearest neighbor, naïve bayes to random forest and decision tree to the SAS enterprise miner. In [1], [2], [3], [5] and [7] all these implementations considered different sets of features in order to make their predictions from the historical data that was used to for training the model. \n",

    "Here, in addition to not just building a prediction model based on the features that impact the prices the most, we have tried to build a web application where a user will be able to go through listings of the cars that are available for sale, make a decision by checking if the listed prices are on the higher or the lower side and therefore, be able to help the user/customer in the decision making to buy or sell a car, thus giving out a better model replacing the existing ones."
